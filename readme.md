# FBC Latest Backup for UpdraftPlus

WordPress plugin that adds a widget to the dashboard, displaying the latest backup date and time and how many edits were made after that.

Please read more about it and download the plugin from [the Official WordPress repository](https://wordpress.org/plugins/fbc-latest-backup-for-updraftplus/).

## Description

This plugin is an extension of UpdraftPlus: it adds a dashboard widget showing the date and time of the latest backup. It also displays how many edits were made after that, if any.

The plugin is currently available for use with UpdraftPlus Backup but it will 'fail silently' if used with another backup plugin (you will see a message telling you to make sure UpdraftPlus Backup plugin is installed and activated).
